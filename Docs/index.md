# Getting Started

Welcome to the Gahdzai codebase!

Right now I'm just using this note to keep track of important things I need to remember about my workflow here, but later this will be a proper overview of the whole codebase, although the root level readme.md will still serve as the proper intro to everything

Anyway, here are my notes for myself

## Starting the App

We actually start in the backend app, but I don't currently have a file like this over there.

We want three terminals, one for the app, one for prisma studio, and one for running commands if we need it

### Backend

We start the app with

`npm run dev`

And Prisma studio with

`npx prisma studio`

### Frontend

Now we can run the following code to start the frontend. We want 4 terminals for the frontend, one for the app, one for testing, one for storybook, and one for running commands if we need it.

We start the app with

`npm run dev`

And run our test watcher with

`npm run test`

We start Storybook with

`npm run storybook`
